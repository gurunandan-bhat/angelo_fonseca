            “Better had I died,” wrote Francis Newton Souza about a
            debilitating childhood bout with smallpox that left his
            face permanently disfigured, “I would not have had to bear
            an artists’ tormented soul, create art in a country that
            despises her artists and is ignorant of her heritage.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The great, relentlessly pioneering artist (1924-2002)
            wrote those lines in his Fragment of an Autobiography,
            which was published by Villiers in London in 1959 during
            difficult years when both money and fame remained mostly
            elusive. Although that plight did alleviate somewhat –
            including a singular heyday of some brief period as an
            acknowledged London luminary alongside masters of the
            contemporary canon like Lucian Freud and Francis Bacon –
            the mixed reception on his homeland has never improved,
            beyond the shallow vagaries of an essentially ignorant art
            marketplace.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is why, even now, despite any number of auction
            records, there is no meaningful scholarship to be found
            anywhere about Souza, and innumerable fake artworks
            continue to be attributed to him, in fact constituting the
            majority of what goes on sale under his name in
            India. This grotesquely shameful charade is cynically,
            cyclically perpetuated by unscrupulous business interests,
            which in the final analysis comprise almost all of what
            passes for the desi art world.
          </p>
          <p>
            If that is the plight of Souza, whose paintings are
            internationally celebrated, on permanent display at the
            Tate Modern in London and National Gallery of Modern Art
            in New Delhi, and regularly snapped up by international
            collectors for prices that long ago crested far above the
            magical benchmark of a million dollars, what about
            everyone else? Have we progressed at all from what this
            son of Saligao complained about in1959, or do we still
            despise our artists and ignore our heritage?
          </p>
          <p>
            Here, even the most wide-eyed optimist must concede that
            the report card is notably poor. Indian art has
            established a fairly robust marketplace at the high end –
            thus the fetish for Souza and his contemporaries, even if
            the paintings are conspicuously dubious - but we have no
            catalogue raisonnés, and only a handful of serious
            retrospectives have ever been held for even the most
            celebrated artists. That vacuum of scholarship and
            understanding allows anyone to mouth any kind of absurd
            gibberish, and get away with it. This is how the committed
            desh bhakt M.F. Husain became tarred with patently
            ridiculous slurs and then forced into exile in the UAE,
            and also explains how and why the unwaveringly hard-edged
            modernist Vasudeo Gaitonde is being steadily repositioned
            into some kind of woolly-headed quasi-spiritual mystic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Understanding the pervasive extent of this uniformly
            pathetic scenario, there is perhaps some cold comfort to
            be derived from the happenstance of an even earlier
            pioneer’s work remaining so totally unknown that it has
            not yet been perverted. This is the curious case of Angelo
            da Fonseca, whose magnificent oeuvre was created in
            yawning obscurity that has only deepened further after his
            death in 1967.
          </p>
          <p>
            How did this staggering lacuna occur in the first place?
            Why did Fonseca’s irresistibly gorgeous paintings
            disappear so thoroughly from our collective understanding
            that even the nearly-1000-page Encyclopaedia of Visual Art
            of Maharashtra – which lists hundreds of artists – fails
            to record even an inkling their presence?  The short
            answer is that there have been several layers of bigotry
            at work, starting with the fatally flawed global backdrop,
            as Dr. Rupert Arrowsmith has most usefully described in
            his invaluable Modernism and the Museum: Asian, African,
            and Pacific Art and the London Avant-Garde (Oxford
            University Press, 2011).
