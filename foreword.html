                    <p>
                        “Better had I died,” wrote Francis Newton Souza about a
                        debilitating childhood bout with smallpox that left his
                        face permanently disfigured, “I would not have had to bear
                        an artists’ tormented soul, create art in a country that
                        despises her artists and is ignorant of her heritage.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The great, relentlessly pioneering artist (1924-2002)
                        wrote those lines in his Fragment of an Autobiography,
                        which was published by Villiers in London in 1959 during
                        difficult years when both money and fame remained mostly
                        elusive. Although that plight did alleviate somewhat –
                        including a singular heyday of some brief period as an
                        acknowledged London luminary alongside masters of the
                        contemporary canon like Lucian Freud and Francis Bacon –
                        the mixed reception on his homeland has never improved,
                        beyond the shallow vagaries of an essentially ignorant art
                        marketplace.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That is why, even now, despite any number of auction
                        records, there is no meaningful scholarship to be found
                        anywhere about Souza, and innumerable fake artworks
                        continue to be attributed to him, in fact constituting the
                        majority of what goes on sale under his name in
                        India. This grotesquely shameful charade is cynically,
                        cyclically perpetuated by unscrupulous business interests,
                        which in the final analysis comprise almost all of what
                        passes for the desi art world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If that is the plight of Souza, whose paintings are
                        internationally celebrated, on permanent display at the
                        Tate Modern in London and National Gallery of Modern Art
                        in New Delhi, and regularly snapped up by international
                        collectors for prices that long ago crested far above the
                        magical benchmark of a million dollars, what about
                        everyone else? Have we progressed at all from what this
                        son of Saligao complained about in1959, or do we still
                        despise our artists and ignore our heritage?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here, even the most wide-eyed optimist must concede that
                        the report card is notably poor. Indian art has
                        established a fairly robust marketplace at the high end –
                        thus the fetish for Souza and his contemporaries, even if
                        the paintings are conspicuously dubious - but we have no
                        catalogue raisonnés, and only a handful of serious
                        retrospectives have ever been held for even the most
                        celebrated artists. That vacuum of scholarship and
                        understanding allows anyone to mouth any kind of absurd
                        gibberish, and get away with it. This is how the committed
                        desh bhakt M.F. Husain became tarred with patently
                        ridiculous slurs and then forced into exile in the UAE,
                        and also explains how and why the unwaveringly hard-edged
                        modernist Vasudeo Gaitonde is being steadily repositioned
                        into some kind of woolly-headed quasi-spiritual mystic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Understanding the pervasive extent of this uniformly
                        pathetic scenario, there is perhaps some cold comfort to
                        be derived from the happenstance of an even earlier
                        pioneer’s work remaining so totally unknown that it has
                        not yet been perverted. This is the curious case of Angelo
                        da Fonseca, whose magnificent oeuvre was created in
                        yawning obscurity that has only deepened further after his
                        death in 1967.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How did this staggering lacuna occur in the first place?
                        Why did Fonseca’s irresistibly gorgeous paintings
                        disappear so thoroughly from our collective understanding
                        that even the nearly-1000-page Encyclopaedia of Visual Art
                        of Maharashtra – which lists hundreds of artists – fails
                        to record even an inkling their presence?  The short
                        answer is that there have been several layers of bigotry
                        at work, starting with the fatally flawed global backdrop,
                        as Dr. Rupert Arrowsmith has most usefully described in
                        his invaluable Modernism and the Museum: Asian, African,
                        and Pacific Art and the London Avant-Garde (Oxford
                        University Press, 2011).
