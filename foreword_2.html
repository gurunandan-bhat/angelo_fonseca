            Arrowsmith lays out the problem on the very first page of
            his introduction: “There is a problem with the study of
            Modernism as a global phenomenon. Histories of the period
            have been written, until very recently, by scholars with
            little or no knowledge of the culture provinces other than
            their own, resulting in a situation where the dots of
            apparently discrete geographical regions are not
            adequately connected by lines of influence.”
          </p>
          <p>
            These blind spots have “led to a distorted view of
            Modernism as essentially a European invention, with
            comparable movements on other parts of the globe
            characterized as imitative of ‘advanced’ art and
            literature in Europe, or – paradoxically – as reactionary
            and propagandistic. The possibility of multi-directional,
            transnational exchange in aesthetic concepts,
            art-historical knowledge, and literary and artistic
            technique is thus discounted, played down, or at best
            acknowledged in tentative and misleading ways.”
          </p>

            That sweeping failure of international (read: Western)
            scholarship has been gravely compounded in India after
            1947, when an urgent – but wholly wrong-headed, and
            ultimately destructive – revisionism swept aside and
            covered up the complex landscape of modernism in India in
            favour of the Tagores and their “Bengal Renaissance.”
            Unsubtly excluded from this lobotomized nationalist art
            history was the spectacular cultural wellspring of the
            entire west coast, but especially the legions of
            extraordinary artists from Goa who flooded to and through
            colonial and mid-20th-century Bombay to constitute what
            Ranjit Hoskote has eloquently described as “an invisible
            river, one that has fed into the wider flow of Indian art
            but has not always been recognised as so doing.”

            In his superb curatorial essay for Aparanta: The
            Confluence of Contemporary Art in Goa, the landmark 2007
            group exhibition on the waterfront of Panjim that marked
            the return of Fonseca to prominence in the cultural fabric
            of his homeland (and also served to save the lovely 19th
            century Old Goa Medical College campus from being co-opted
            into a shopping mall) Hoskote explained some of the causes
            of this dissonance: “Goa’s special historic evolution,
            with its Lusitanian route to the Enlightenment and print
            modernity, its Iberian emphasis on a vibrant public
            sphere, its pride in its ancient internationalism avant la
            lettre, sets it at a tangent to the self-image of an India
            that has been formed with the experience of British
            colonialism as its basis. The relationship between Goa’s
            artists and mainland India has, not surprisingly, been
            ambiguous and erratic, even unstable.”
          </p>

	    It is a strange, oftentimes surreal predicament. From the
	    very inception of the paradigm-shifting Sir JJ School of
	    Art in 1878, it was sought out by vastly disproportionate
	    numbers of Goans (as were other institutions set up in
	    colonial Bombay at the same time, notably the Grant
	    Medical College). By the turn of the century, the great
	    pioneer Antonio Xavier Trindade – the heavily feted
	    “Rembrandt of the East” – was one of its first Indian
	    faculty members, and streams of his countryfolk followed
	    in his wake.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    It is important to note here that most of this grand
	    artistic legacy has been either purposefully erased from
	    the record, or deliberately co-opted into sketchy
	    narratives that efface their origins. This is because of a
	    grand overarching prejudice, because the Goa-Bombay
	    artists – which is actually the best way to understand the
	    seminal Progressive Artists Group– have always been
	    irredeemably heterogeneous. Souza’s cohort was defiantly
	    scruffy compared to the Shantiniketan bhadralok: Husain
	    painted road signs, Ara was a houseboy. The very presence
	    of these kinds of Indians has been treated as an affront
	    to Indian art history, and there can be no doubt the
	    establishment would have preferred to erase them from our
	    consciousness altogether. That surely would have happened,
	    if it had not been for increasingly wealthy non-resident
	    Indians and their impact on the 21st century art
	    marketplace.
