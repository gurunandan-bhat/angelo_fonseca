                        Arrowsmith lays out the problem on the very first page of
                        his introduction: “There is a problem with the study of
                        Modernism as a global phenomenon. Histories of the period
                        have been written, until very recently, by scholars with
                        little or no knowledge of the culture provinces other than
                        their own, resulting in a situation where the dots of
                        apparently discrete geographical regions are not
                        adequately connected by lines of influence.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These blind spots have “led to a distorted view of
                        Modernism as essentially a European invention, with
                        comparable movements on other parts of the globe
                        characterized as imitative of ‘advanced’ art and
                        literature in Europe, or – paradoxically – as reactionary
                        and propagandistic. The possibility of multi-directional,
                        transnational exchange in aesthetic concepts,
                        art-historical knowledge, and literary and artistic
                        technique is thus discounted, played down, or at best
                        acknowledged in tentative and misleading ways.”

                        That sweeping failure of international (read: Western)
                        scholarship has been gravely compounded in India after
                        1947, when an urgent – but wholly wrong-headed, and
                        ultimately destructive – revisionism swept aside and
                        covered up the complex landscape of modernism in India in
                        favour of the Tagores and their “Bengal Renaissance.”
                        Unsubtly excluded from this lobotomized nationalist art
                        history was the spectacular cultural wellspring of the
                        entire west coast, but especially the legions of
                        extraordinary artists from Goa who flooded to and through
                        colonial and mid-20th-century Bombay to constitute what
                        Ranjit Hoskote has eloquently described as “an invisible
                        river, one that has fed into the wider flow of Indian art
                        but has not always been recognised as so doing.”

                        In his superb curatorial essay for Aparanta: The
                        Confluence of Contemporary Art in Goa, the landmark 2007
                        group exhibition on the waterfront of Panjim that marked
                        the return of Fonseca to prominence in the cultural fabric
                        of his homeland (and also served to save the lovely 19th
                        century Old Goa Medical College campus from being co-opted
                        into a shopping mall) Hoskote explained some of the causes
                        of this dissonance: “Goa’s special historic evolution,
                        with its Lusitanian route to the Enlightenment and print
                        modernity, its Iberian emphasis on a vibrant public
                        sphere, its pride in its ancient internationalism avant la
                        lettre, sets it at a tangent to the self-image of an India
                        that has been formed with the experience of British
                        colonialism as its basis. The relationship between Goa’s
                        artists and mainland India has, not surprisingly, been
                        ambiguous and erratic, even unstable.”

                        It is a strange, oftentimes surreal predicament. From the
                        very inception of the paradigm-shifting Sir JJ School of
                        Art in 1878, it was sought out by vastly disproportionate
                        numbers of Goans (as were other institutions set up in
                        colonial Bombay at the same time, notably the Grant
                        Medical College). By the turn of the century, the great
                        pioneer Antonio Xavier Trindade – the heavily feted
                        “Rembrandt of the East” – was one of its first Indian
                        faculty members, and streams of his countryfolk followed
                        in his wake.

                        It is important to note here that most of this grand
                        artistic legacy has been either purposefully erased from
                        the record, or deliberately co-opted into sketchy
                        narratives that efface their origins. This is because of a
                        grand overarching prejudice, because the Goa-Bombay
                        artists – which is actually the best way to understand the
                        seminal Progressive Artists Group– have always been
                        irredeemably heterogeneous. Souza’s cohort was defiantly
                        scruffy compared to the Shantiniketan bhadralok: Husain
                        painted road signs, Ara was a houseboy. The very presence
                        of these kinds of Indians has been treated as an affront
                        to Indian art history, and there can be no doubt the
                        establishment would have preferred to erase them from our
                        consciousness altogether. That surely would have happened,
                        if it had not been for increasingly wealthy non-resident
                        Indians and their impact on the 21st century art
                        marketplace.
