	    These are all-important cultural fault lines – and here we
	    must remember that both Souza and Gaitonde died in
	    effective penury only two decades ago – but there is
	    plenty of culpability that is shared by Goa and Goans as
	    well. We have massively compounded the art historical
	    crime that Souza pointed out way back in 1959, because
	    both state and society have displayed an unimaginably
	    cavalier disregard for our own heritage, in an astonishing
	    abdication of responsibility that has few rivals anywhere
	    in the world. Thus, despite being the inheritors of an
	    unrivalled artistic legacy that extends millennia to the
	    dawn of mankind in this part of the world, the average
	    Goan student learns exactly zero about this bountiful
	    birthright. Even worse, the government has done nothing to
	    rectify this crisis, and compiled no permanent collection
	    to speak of, while also neglecting to constitute the
	    museum framework required to properly display and explain
	    the few meagre scraps it has managed to retain after
	    generations of despoilation (for example, the Kala
	    Academy’s small trove of excellent Gaitonde canvases has
	    been “missing” for the past two decades).

	    In this giant mess, which shows no sign whatsoever of
	    being resolved, the existence of the best part of Angelo
	    da Fonseca’s oeuvre poses an epic challenge, as well as
	    its potential resolution. This ultimate bridge figure, who
	    was born into an aristocratic Luso-Indian family but spent
	    most of his life in happy anonymity in a spartan ashram in
	    Poona from the 1930s onwards, whose artwork has always
	    fallen between the cracks as too Indian for rigidly
	    Eurocentric Catholics and too Christian for
	    nationalism-blinkered Indians, has been retrieved from the
	    ash-heap of history at precisely the most promising
	    juncture, into an era that appears poised to understand
	    and appreciate his brilliant paintings for the same exact
	    reasons that our grandparents found them hard to
	    digest. This is a bolt of lightning that commands the
	    rewriting of all of our cultural notions. Here is our
	    universal master, and India’s most important early
	    modernist.

            It was an earthquake moment, even if reverberations have
            not been felt from it for many years. In today’s light,
            the paintings are flat out undeniable. The reality of
            their existence luminously intense riposte to all the
            conventional wisdom about what lies at the heart of our
            collective identity as Goans, Indians, and inheritors of
            multiple cultural strands that encompass the world. When
            they first came to Goa, many important visitors came to
            view them almost like pilgrims: Orhan Pamuk, Amitav Ghosh,
            Dayanita Singh, Vikram Seth. The art scholars also came,
            including Rupert Arrowsmith, whom I invited to India
            specifically to view the Fonseca archive, after which he
            agreed that it’s “time to look at Fonseca again, and to
            recognize him as a cosmopolitan artist fully at home
            within the eclectic, transcultural landscape of Indian
            Modernism.”

            The story of Angelo da Fonseca is inextricably intertwined
            with the profoundly confluential history of Goa. His
            ancestral roots are on the ancient island of Santo Estêvão
            – aka Santo Estevam or Jua – where the story is told that
            his father and mother kept losing their children in
            infancy, totalling an agonizing six or seven babies a
            row. Then, advised by some old-timer, they acceded to
            pre-conversion traditions and paid tribute to an ancestral
            temple in the hinterland. After that gesture, they were
            blessed with several children who did survive, including
            the preternaturally talented youngest son, whom – in the
            tradition of well-to-do Goans of the time – they sent off
            to study across the border in British India from an early
            age.
