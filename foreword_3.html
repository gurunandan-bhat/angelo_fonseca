                        These are all-important cultural fault lines – and here we
                        must remember that both Souza and Gaitonde died in
                        effective penury only two decades ago – but there is
                        plenty of culpability that is shared by Goa and Goans as
                        well. We have massively compounded the art historical
                        crime that Souza pointed out way back in 1959, because
                        both state and society have displayed an unimaginably
                        cavalier disregard for our own heritage, in an astonishing
                        abdication of responsibility that has few rivals anywhere
                        in the world. Thus, despite being the inheritors of an
                        unrivalled artistic legacy that extends millennia to the
                        dawn of mankind in this part of the world, the average
                        Goan student learns exactly zero about this bountiful
                        birthright. Even worse, the government has done nothing to
                        rectify this crisis, and compiled no permanent collection
                        to speak of, while also neglecting to constitute the
                        museum framework required to properly display and explain
                        the few meagre scraps it has managed to retain after
                        generations of despoilation (for example, the Kala
                        Academy’s small trove of excellent Gaitonde canvases has
                        been “missing” for the past two decades).

                        In this giant mess, which shows no sign whatsoever of
                        being resolved, the existence of the best part of Angelo
                        da Fonseca’s oeuvre poses an epic challenge, as well as
                        its potential resolution. This ultimate bridge figure, who
                        was born into an aristocratic Luso-Indian family but spent
                        most of his life in happy anonymity in a spartan ashram in
                        Poona from the 1930s onwards, whose artwork has always
                        fallen between the cracks as too Indian for rigidly
                        Eurocentric Catholics and too Christian for
                        nationalism-blinkered Indians, has been retrieved from the
                        ash-heap of history at precisely the most promising
                        juncture, into an era that appears poised to understand
                        and appreciate his brilliant paintings for the same exact
                        reasons that our grandparents found them hard to
                        digest. This is a bolt of lightning that commands the
                        rewriting of all of our cultural notions. Here is our
                        universal master, and India’s most important early
                        modernist.

                        It was an earthquake moment, even if reverberations have
                        not been felt from it for many years. In today’s light,
                        the paintings are flat out undeniable. The reality of
                        their existence luminously intense riposte to all the
                        conventional wisdom about what lies at the heart of our
                        collective identity as Goans, Indians, and inheritors of
                        multiple cultural strands that encompass the world. When
                        they first came to Goa, many important visitors came to
                        view them almost like pilgrims: Orhan Pamuk, Amitav Ghosh,
                        Dayanita Singh, Vikram Seth. The art scholars also came,
                        including Rupert Arrowsmith, whom I invited to India
                        specifically to view the Fonseca archive, after which he
                        agreed that it’s “time to look at Fonseca again, and to
                        recognize him as a cosmopolitan artist fully at home
                        within the eclectic, transcultural landscape of Indian
                        Modernism.”

                        The story of Angelo da Fonseca is inextricably intertwined
                        with the profoundly confluential history of Goa. His
                        ancestral roots are on the ancient island of Santo Estêvão
                        – aka Santo Estevam or Jua – where the story is told that
                        his father and mother kept losing their children in
                        infancy, totalling an agonizing six or seven babies a
                        row. Then, advised by some old-timer, they acceded to
                        pre-conversion traditions and paid tribute to an ancestral
                        temple in the hinterland. After that gesture, they were
                        blessed with several children who did survive, including
                        the preternaturally talented youngest son, whom – in the
                        tradition of well-to-do Goans of the time – they sent off
                        to study across the border in British India from an early
                        age.
