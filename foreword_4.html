                        Fonseca left home at no more than seven or eight years of
                        age, heading first to the St. Paul’s School in Belgaum –
                        where there were many other Goans – and later rooted
                        himself, with consequential future implications, in the
                        bigger and more important cantonment city of Poona at
                        St. Vincent’s School. After graduation, he first tried
                        becoming a physician at Grant Medical College (where he
                        was singled out for excellence in drawing in his Anatomy
                        class) but then gave it up to join the JJ School of Art.

                    <p>
                        All along, the artist recalls in his quirky, fascinating
                        Indo-Christian Art in Painting and Statuary: A Historical
                        Retrospect, that was published by St. Xavier’s College in
                        1953, he harboured an overwhelming ambition: “since my
                        artistic instinct began to develop; and [I became aware
                        of] the great variety of the artistic production that has
                        sprung under the encouragement of the Church all the world
                        over -- from the frescoes of the Catacombs of purely Roman
                        inspiration down to the statuary of the Gothic cathedrals
                        and the great Masters of the Renaissance period – [they]
                        could not but be contrasted with the poor stereotyped
                        specimens we always saw in the churches of our country.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fonseca explains at some length, no less passionately for
                        it being a flawed and decidedly dubious argument: “A
                        Renaissance building under the sun of India, having the
                        now-clad Himalayas on its background, looks incongruous to
                        say the least, something unwholesome and morbid, if
                        compared with the lofty specimens of our ancient religious
                        architecture that try to emulate the high peak of Mount
                        Meru or the majestic slopes of Kailasha. Why could not the
                        Catholic Church find herself at home in India, since she
                        is really Catholic, i.e. universal, Indian in India as she
                        is European in Europe.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Later in that meandering essay, the artist etches out what
                        sounds like his personal manifesto: “The Indian Catholic
                        has generally been brought up on products of the West --
                        very cheap and unartistic products at that, as a general
                        rule -- and consequently our art is strange to him. But if
                        the priests introduce the art of India in our churches,
                        the layman will naturally take it to his home. But we
                        artists must make an effort to create real devotional
                        pictures, and not merely to put a halo behind the head of
                        a beautiful woman or inscribe a label at the foot of an
                        ordinary man. Let therefore devotion be the substratum of
                        inspiration, and that fostered by the breezes that descend
                        from the lofty Himalayas.”

                    <p>
                        By this point, Fonseca had suffered mightily for his
                        convictions. After heading home to Goa, he found himself
                        the object of severe familial and ecclesiastical
                        opprobrium for painting ostensible “holy pictures” that
                        were vastly different from those peddled by the colonial
                        church. He was shaken, then fled back to the city where he
                        had spent happy schooldays, and took up residence in the
                        austere, high-minded Christa Prema Seva Sangha that had
                        been founded by the Anglican minister John “Jack” Winslow
                        just a few years earlier in 1927. The patrician Goan was
                        happy there amongst well-educated (indeed, often
                        aristocratic) Englishmen seeking to understand India, and
                        was eventually given charge of its grounds. Even after
                        marrying, he would return every day to work, often in the
                        company of his close friends from Goa, the great poet
                        B. B. “Bakibab” Borkar and the nationalist priest,
                        Rev. Hubert Olympio Mascarenhas.

                    <p>
                        When he had first fled to Poona, there was no one else
                        doing anything quite like Fonseca, but by 1953 a number of
                        other artists had followed in his footsteps in the vein of
                        “Indian Christian” imagery, even if very few had the depth
                        or originality of his work. But he does note that “Joseph
                        Pereira is a budding artist of great promise” adding that
                        “it is a pity that he leans more to the West than to the
                        East. His paintings at times are left unfinished. He
                        should be more Indian in his composition and even in this
                        technique.” This is an important intersection from our
                        standpoint, because Joseph is better known to us as
                        Dr. José Pereira, the brilliant polymath with a
                        relentlessly taxonomical bent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pereira – whom I was lucky to get to know well in the last
                        decade of his life – was an unbounded encyclopaedist. He
                        categorized and catalogued everything in meticulous –
                        indeed monomaniacal – detail, and we are eternally
                        indebted that his lens returned often to Goan culture in
                        different dimensions: music, language, architecture,
                        art. He wrote this assessment (which he told me later was
                        “ironclad”) of Fonseca at what we now realize was almost
                        the last possible moment, just a few months before he
                        passed away in New York at 84. It had been nearly five
                        long decades since the older Goan artist had himself
                        succumbed (to meningitis, in Poona) and all those
                        intervening years had whizzed by entirely uneventfully,
                        until the thunderclap decision by Ivy da Fonseca to gather
                        all of her late husband’s artworks from three or four
                        separate locations in the city now renamed Pune, and drive
                        them down physically to Goa in 2006, with the
                        understanding they would be available to scholars and on
                        permanent display at the Xavier Centre of Historical
                        Research.
