                        One especially significant reaction was from Paulo Varela
                        Gomes, the late architectural historian who did an
                        excellent job as Goa delegate of the Lisbon-based Fundação
                        Oriente (sadly the same cannot be said for many of the
                        others who have occupied the same position).

                        Goans have a special interest in awakening Indian and
                        international attention to Angelo da Fonseca’s importance
                        as he was one of Goa’s more significant twentieth-century
                        artists. But there is something else at stake here,
                        something of far greater consequence than regional pride
                        or identity. Some of the drawings and paintings by
                        Fonseca—those with Christian subject matter, perhaps his
                        more engaging works—directly bring to the fore the
                        political, religious and cultural concerns of the early
                        twenty-first century in a manner that is unavoidable for
                        those interested in the role played by art in
                        society. Fonseca’s art deals with ecumenical ideals, with
                        the necessity of dialogue between ‘civilisations’ and
                        religions, a dramatically-pressing topic for our times. It
                        also deals with the place of Christianity in India and in
                        Indian history, an issue that has recently given rise to
                        episodes of violence and persecution and is paralleled by
                        other unfortunate instances of intolerance and brutality
                        between communities in India and elsewhere. This should
                        draw immediate and urgent scholarly attention to Fonseca’s
                        art.

                        By happy circumstance, and then in adulthood by purposeful
                        design, the story of Fonseca is intertwined with mine at
                        multiple junctures going right back 100 years to the
                        British Raj and St. Vincent’s School in Poona. My maternal
                        grandfather William Xavier Mascarenhas (whose ancestral
                        roots are in Porvorim) was his good friend from those
                        years, and the two remained steadfastly loyal to each
                        other despite one becoming something like a recluse at the
                        Anglican ashram beyond the outskirts of town, and the
                        other being catapulted into the top job at his alma mater,
                        the storied Engineering College where he became the first
                        “native” Indian principal in 1938. There are lovely
                        stories passed down in our families about how the most
                        important international visitors to that institution were
                        treated to a grand Luso-Indian meal cooked by Fonseca
                        himself – who prided himself as an outstanding chef –
                        during which the artist would join the gathering to
                        explain what he had prepared.

                    <p>
                        Just a few years after the artist died, my parents spent
                        some years in Poona (it only became Pune in 1978) where I
                        was blessed to have Ivy da Fonseca as my very first
                        teacher. She taught me to read in very pleasant school
                        years, that remained indelibly rooted in my consciousness
                        because much of what remained of my schooling was
                        distinctly unhappy. Much later on, after Ivy and I had
                        reconnected, and she had begun to spend time in Goa to try
                        and assist the XCHR in creating its promised centre of
                        scholarship for her husband’s artworks, we were honoured
                        that she attended the baptism of my youngest son, to whom
                        I was proud to give the name Angelo. All through those
                        years more than a decade ago, the author of this book and
                        I worked very happily together to achieve our mission to
                        keep our promise to Ivy and ourselves, secure in the
                        confidence that this great artist’s work would not
                        continue to languish so unconscionably.

                        Exceedingly sadly, it did not happen. Our path was
                        disrupted, then wilfully diverted. Fonseca was wrenched
                        from our lives, and the bitter truth is an additional
                        generation of Goans proceeded to pass all the way through
                        school without an inkling of this great artist’s very real
                        value to their lives. Only a few knew and understood what
                        was at stake, and for them it rankled very deeply. Amongst
                        these was my late mother Naomi Mascarenhas e Menezes, the
                        daughter of W. X. Mascarenhas and niece of
                        H. O. Mascarenhas, who never failed to enquire after this
                        important unfinished business, literally right until her
                        voice was finally extinguished.
