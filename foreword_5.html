            One especially significant reaction was from Paulo Varela
            Gomes, the late architectural historian who did an
            excellent job as Goa delegate of the Lisbon-based Fundação
            Oriente (sadly the same cannot be said for many of the
            others who have occupied the same position).

            Goans have a special interest in awakening Indian and
            international attention to Angelo da Fonseca’s importance
            as he was one of Goa’s more significant twentieth-century
            artists. But there is something else at stake here,
            something of far greater consequence than regional pride
            or identity. Some of the drawings and paintings by
            Fonseca—those with Christian subject matter, perhaps his
            more engaging works—directly bring to the fore the
            political, religious and cultural concerns of the early
            twenty-first century in a manner that is unavoidable for
            those interested in the role played by art in
            society. Fonseca’s art deals with ecumenical ideals, with
            the necessity of dialogue between ‘civilisations’ and
            religions, a dramatically-pressing topic for our times. It
            also deals with the place of Christianity in India and in
            Indian history, an issue that has recently given rise to
            episodes of violence and persecution and is paralleled by
            other unfortunate instances of intolerance and brutality
            between communities in India and elsewhere. This should
            draw immediate and urgent scholarly attention to Fonseca’s
            art.

            By happy circumstance, and then in adulthood by purposeful
            design, the story of Fonseca is intertwined with mine at
            multiple junctures going right back 100 years to the
            British Raj and St. Vincent’s School in Poona. My maternal
            grandfather William Xavier Mascarenhas (whose ancestral
            roots are in Porvorim) was his good friend from those
            years, and the two remained steadfastly loyal to each
            other despite one becoming something like a recluse at the
            Anglican ashram beyond the outskirts of town, and the
            other being catapulted into the top job at his alma mater,
            the storied Engineering College where he became the first
            “native” Indian principal in 1938. There are lovely
            stories passed down in our families about how the most
            important international visitors to that institution were
            treated to a grand Luso-Indian meal cooked by Fonseca
            himself – who prided himself as an outstanding chef –
            during which the artist would join the gathering to
            explain what he had prepared.
          </p>

            Just a few years after the artist died, my parents spent
            some years in Poona (it only became Pune in 1978) where I
            was blessed to have Ivy da Fonseca as my very first
            teacher. She taught me to read in very pleasant school
            years, that remained indelibly rooted in my consciousness
            because much of what remained of my schooling was
            distinctly unhappy. Much later on, after Ivy and I had
            reconnected, and she had begun to spend time in Goa to try
            and assist the XCHR in creating its promised centre of
            scholarship for her husband’s artworks, we were honoured
            that she attended the baptism of my youngest son, to whom
            I was proud to give the name Angelo. All through those
            years more than a decade ago, the author of this book and
            I worked very happily together to achieve our mission to
            keep our promise to Ivy and ourselves, secure in the
            confidence that this great artist’s work would not
            continue to languish so unconscionably.
          </p>
          <p>
            Exceedingly sadly, it did not happen. Our path was
            disrupted, then wilfully diverted. Fonseca was wrenched
            from our lives, and the bitter truth is an additional
            generation of Goans proceeded to pass all the way through
            school without an inkling of this great artist’s very real
            value to their lives. Only a few knew and understood what
            was at stake, and for them it rankled very deeply. Amongst
            these was my late mother Naomi Mascarenhas e Menezes, the
            daughter of W. X. Mascarenhas and niece of
            H. O. Mascarenhas, who never failed to enquire after this
            important unfinished business, literally right until her
            voice was finally extinguished.
