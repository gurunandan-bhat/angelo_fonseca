                    <p>
                        Fonseca’s compositions do not highlight material realism
                        or real objects of desire and possession, as oil paintings
                        in the western tradition, particularly in the rococo
                        style, do. His watercolours shun the opulent vision and
                        perspective of the sixteenth to nineteenth century western
                        oil painting traditions, that the material world is out
                        there to be possessed and controlled at human whim. The
                        western world held on to realism and illusory perspective,
                        to convince itself it had the world under its
                        control. Such art was designed to create an aura of man’s
                        mastery over other men and the material worlds.
                        Impressionist and abstract arts critiqued the assumptions
                        of officious art realism and distanced themselves from
                        it. Fonseca invites us to turn our attention to
                        ourselves. His works represent an inner journey of
                        discovery, an invitation to ‘know thyself’.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fonseca’s oeuvres come in small size frames, some of them
                        almost miniatures.  This scale imparts neither a great
                        sense of overbearing realism nor materiality. The message
                        and meaning he wanted to communicate cannot be reduced to
                        finite reality, perishable wealth, or objects of
                        desire. Like Byzantine iconography, his works take
                        possession of the believer or viewer, which is the aim of
                        rasa, (emotional or aesthetic impression of a work of art)
                        and reveals the viewer's subjective self, human
                        limitations, and responsibility towards the material world
                        and society. As a guide to a sacred and sublime human
                        purpose, his oeuvres become an interface between divine
                        realities and human social
                        responsibilities. Michelangelo’s powerful image of God’s
                        outstretched finger in the Creation of Adam painted on the
                        Sistine Chapel’s ceiling, represents the breath of life
                        communicated to Adam and all humanity. Similarly, the
                        sober watercolours of Fonseca reveal and convey humanistic
                        values compellingly necessary for a country on the cusp of
                        a new independence, where responsibility must come with
                        empowerment and freedom.

                    <p>
                        With Fonseca’s radical departure from western Christian
                        artistic traditions, his works did not serve the tastes,
                        desires and purpose of an insatiable ruling class, who
                        value materialism and power. This was the main reason why
                        the wealthy ignored him and his art, and were never
                        concerned with taking possession of his work. Much as the
                        market was never a priority for Fonseca, he did
                        acknowledge that it was not easy either to sell his
                        paintings or to live by them. His patrons were not
                        wealthy. His paintings spoke to the soul and addressed
                        social issues. They did not offer social status.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fonseca’s art serves as a window through which we can see
                        what had happened for centuries to Christianity in
                        India. His attempt to articulate a decolonized
                        Christianity both in art practice and in Christian
                        iconography, makes Fonseca a pioneer of postcolonial
                        thought in India. Through the visual arts, he achieved
                        rather early what the Church in India attempted forty
                        years later through its theologians and their writings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One reason for this time lag could be because the Church
                        could not afford any deviation in faith and doctrine and
                        therefore vetted all theological writing. However, the
                        fact remains that contextual Christian art preceded by
                        decades the first visible efforts by the Church to
                        Indianise Christianity and its image.  The idea of
                        darshan, interpreted in Indian philosophy and religions as
                        a ‘vision’ of the sublime sacred -- mental image aided by
                        visual art -- plays an important role in Indian culture.
                        Consequently, articulation of experience or thought in
                        language or writing (logos in Greek philosophy) is a
                        secondary human activity. Artists are able to present and
                        enjoy that darshan, whereas Indian theologians have lagged
                        far behind!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fonseca’s counter-narrative to colonialism asserts that
                        the West was never the only cradle of beauty and artistic
                        creativity.  Nevertheless, Fonseca stood for a synthesis
                        of the finest artistic and humanistic traditions in the
                        country and beyond. His oeuvres indicate a manifestly
                        unusual confluence and unmistakable ground-breaking path,
                        despite their subdued lines, colours, compositions and
                        small scale. The clothes, the human figures, and his
                        minimalist approach in representing surroundings, are
                        striking pointers to an Oriental hallowed vision (darshan)
                        and moral values (dharma), combined with his personal
                        Christian life and beliefs.  The formal aspects of any art
                        are never the entire message. So far Fonseca’s works have
                        been assessed by their formal elements as well as the
                        subject matter of his compositions. In my view, that
                        approach continues to be reductionist and misleading.
                        Only recently, the message of Fonseca’s art as well as its
                        deeper layers of signification, are beginning to unfold.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Returning to the painting of the Creation of Adam in the
                        Vatican, the viewer’s attention is drawn to the iconic
                        finger of God. The finger is indeed an important formal
                        element to be appreciated, however, it also symbolises
                        complex levels of signification in the Creation
                        narrative. “Formal innovations are important but they are
                        never seen in a vacuum. They always come hand in hand with
                        aspirations for social transformation.”  Multiple, deeper
                        levels of social meaning in Fonseca’s artworks have not
                        yet been fully decoded. The polyvalence of his art was
                        often conveniently or unconsciously oversimplified,
                        mystified, and finally ignored.

                    <p>
                        For an inclusive understanding of religious art in India,
                        where the sacred is neither confined to narrow religious
                        spaces nor regarded as anti-secular, a transdisciplinary
                        approach -- referenced on its philosophical worldview,
                        social analysis, poetic interpretation, ideological
                        interests and whatever the sacred is being harnessed to &mdash;
                        is an essential precondition.  Classical and elitist art
                        appreciation approaches interpret art based mainly on its
                        formal elements with little or no reference to the social
                        and political contexts that produced that art. Such an
                        approach is aimed at justifying and promoting a certain
                        idea of beauty as universal; endorsing certain kinds of
                        ethics and aesthetics to maintain the status quo.  It
                        stifled the human and artistic creativity of other peoples
                        of the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since Fonseca’s art involves a confluence of styles and
                        messages, it invites the viewer to see more than meets the
                        eye. The outreaching finger of God alone is not what we
                        should look at!  Like Fonseca, the art of all great
                        masters, is an invitation to return to our past and
                        present responsibilities.  It is a challenge to abandon
                        secure and familiar ground, for loftier planes, where the
                        darshan is more holistic and sublime!  The final chapter
                        will examine the other reasons why Fonseca’s artworks and
                        messages have been ignored, as well as the germane issues
                        his art raises today. A specific historical context needs
                        to be constructed to decipher his artistic purpose and
                        everything else that goes with it. This book aims at
                        positioning Fonseca’s work, message and the man himself on
                        the right track!  Inshallah!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fonseca’s art can still raise questions of social and
                        political significance, if positioned and understood
                        within the time frame in which it was produced. History
                        can provide crucial answers about his work but the past
                        need not prevent us from drawing meaningful
                        reinterpretations and insights.  Some religious, social
                        and political paradoxes encountered in his works and life
                        need to be either reconciled or understood.  For instance,
                        the imperatives that led Fonseca to single-mindedly remain
                        within the Christian art genre, need to be appreciated,
                        since this rigid stance appears to some to have hindered
                        his larger artistic interests and potential.  Fortunately,
                        the work of geniuses, religious or others, outlive and
                        outweigh the prejudices and short-sightedness of their
                        times. Masterpieces have the capability to correct both
                        our and the artists’ misplaced zeal and connect us to our
                        rationality.  However, decoding masterpieces may not
                        always be easy, particularly when they have been
                        misinterpreted or undervalued for a long time.
