          <p>
            Fonseca’s compositions do not highlight material realism
            or real objects of desire and possession, as oil paintings
            in the western tradition, particularly in the rococo
            style, do. His watercolours shun the opulent vision and
            perspective of the sixteenth to nineteenth century western
            oil painting traditions, that the material world is out
            there to be possessed and controlled at human whim. The
            western world held on to realism and illusory perspective,
            to convince itself it had the world under its
            control. Such art was designed to create an aura of man’s
            mastery over other men and the material worlds.
            Impressionist and abstract arts critiqued the assumptions
            of officious art realism and distanced themselves from
            it. Fonseca invites us to turn our attention to
            ourselves. His works represent an inner journey of
            discovery, an invitation to ‘know thyself’.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fonseca’s oeuvres come in small size frames, some of them
            almost miniatures.  This scale imparts neither a great
            sense of overbearing realism nor materiality. The message
            and meaning he wanted to communicate cannot be reduced to
            finite reality, perishable wealth, or objects of
            desire. Like Byzantine iconography, his works take
            possession of the believer or viewer, which is the aim of
            rasa, (emotional or aesthetic impression of a work of art)
            and reveals the viewer's subjective self, human
            limitations, and responsibility towards the material world
            and society. As a guide to a sacred and sublime human
            purpose, his oeuvres become an interface between divine
            realities and human social
            responsibilities. Michelangelo’s powerful image of God’s
            outstretched finger in the Creation of Adam painted on the
            Sistine Chapel’s ceiling, represents the breath of life
            communicated to Adam and all humanity. Similarly, the
            sober watercolours of Fonseca reveal and convey humanistic
            values compellingly necessary for a country on the cusp of
            a new independence, where responsibility must come with
            empowerment and freedom.
          </p>
          <p>
            With Fonseca’s radical departure from western Christian
            artistic traditions, his works did not serve the tastes,
            desires and purpose of an insatiable ruling class, who
            value materialism and power. This was the main reason why
            the wealthy ignored him and his art, and were never
            concerned with taking possession of his work. Much as the
            market was never a priority for Fonseca, he did
            acknowledge that it was not easy either to sell his
            paintings or to live by them. His patrons were not
            wealthy. His paintings spoke to the soul and addressed
            social issues. They did not offer social status.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fonseca’s art serves as a window through which we can see
            what had happened for centuries to Christianity in
            India. His attempt to articulate a decolonized
            Christianity both in art practice and in Christian
            iconography, makes Fonseca a pioneer of postcolonial
            thought in India. Through the visual arts, he achieved
            rather early what the Church in India attempted forty
            years later through its theologians and their writings.
          </p>
          <p>
            One reason for this time lag could be because the Church
            could not afford any deviation in faith and doctrine and
            therefore vetted all theological writing. However, the
            fact remains that contextual Christian art preceded by
            decades the first visible efforts by the Church to
            Indianise Christianity and its image.  The idea of
            darshan, interpreted in Indian philosophy and religions as
            a ‘vision’ of the sublime sacred -- mental image aided by
            visual art -- plays an important role in Indian culture.
            Consequently, articulation of experience or thought in
            language or writing (logos in Greek philosophy) is a
            secondary human activity. Artists are able to present and
            enjoy that darshan, whereas Indian theologians have lagged
            far behind!
          </p>
          <p>
            Fonseca’s counter-narrative to colonialism asserts that
            the West was never the only cradle of beauty and artistic
            creativity.  Nevertheless, Fonseca stood for a synthesis
            of the finest artistic and humanistic traditions in the
            country and beyond. His oeuvres indicate a manifestly
            unusual confluence and unmistakable ground-breaking path,
            despite their subdued lines, colours, compositions and
            small scale. The clothes, the human figures, and his
            minimalist approach in representing surroundings, are
            striking pointers to an Oriental hallowed vision (darshan)
            and moral values (dharma), combined with his personal
            Christian life and beliefs.  The formal aspects of any art
            are never the entire message. So far Fonseca’s works have
            been assessed by their formal elements as well as the
            subject matter of his compositions. In my view, that
            approach continues to be reductionist and misleading.
            Only recently, the message of Fonseca’s art as well as its
            deeper layers of signification, are beginning to unfold.
          </p>
          <p>
            Returning to the painting of the Creation of Adam in the
            Vatican, the viewer’s attention is drawn to the iconic
            finger of God. The finger is indeed an important formal
            element to be appreciated, however, it also symbolises
            complex levels of signification in the Creation
            narrative. “Formal innovations are important but they are
            never seen in a vacuum. They always come hand in hand with
            aspirations for social transformation.”  Multiple, deeper
            levels of social meaning in Fonseca’s artworks have not
            yet been fully decoded. The polyvalence of his art was
            often conveniently or unconsciously oversimplified,
            mystified, and finally ignored.
          </p>
          <p>
            For an inclusive understanding of religious art in India,
            where the sacred is neither confined to narrow religious
            spaces nor regarded as anti-secular, a transdisciplinary
            approach -- referenced on its philosophical worldview,
            social analysis, poetic interpretation, ideological
            interests and whatever the sacred is being harnessed to &mdash;
            is an essential precondition.  Classical and elitist art
            appreciation approaches interpret art based mainly on its
            formal elements with little or no reference to the social
            and political contexts that produced that art. Such an
            approach is aimed at justifying and promoting a certain
            idea of beauty as universal; endorsing certain kinds of
            ethics and aesthetics to maintain the status quo.  It
            stifled the human and artistic creativity of other peoples
            of the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since Fonseca’s art involves a confluence of styles and
            messages, it invites the viewer to see more than meets the
            eye. The outreaching finger of God alone is not what we
            should look at!  Like Fonseca, the art of all great
            masters, is an invitation to return to our past and
            present responsibilities.  It is a challenge to abandon
            secure and familiar ground, for loftier planes, where the
            darshan is more holistic and sublime!  The final chapter
            will examine the other reasons why Fonseca’s artworks and
            messages have been ignored, as well as the germane issues
            his art raises today. A specific historical context needs
            to be constructed to decipher his artistic purpose and
            everything else that goes with it. This book aims at
            positioning Fonseca’s work, message and the man himself on
            the right track!  Inshallah!
          </p>
          <p>
            Fonseca’s art can still raise questions of social and
            political significance, if positioned and understood
            within the time frame in which it was produced. History
            can provide crucial answers about his work but the past
            need not prevent us from drawing meaningful
            reinterpretations and insights.  Some religious, social
            and political paradoxes encountered in his works and life
            need to be either reconciled or understood.  For instance,
            the imperatives that led Fonseca to single-mindedly remain
            within the Christian art genre, need to be appreciated,
            since this rigid stance appears to some to have hindered
            his larger artistic interests and potential.  Fortunately,
            the work of geniuses, religious or others, outlive and
            outweigh the prejudices and short-sightedness of their
            times. Masterpieces have the capability to correct both
            our and the artists’ misplaced zeal and connect us to our
            rationality.  However, decoding masterpieces may not
            always be easy, particularly when they have been
            misinterpreted or undervalued for a long time.
