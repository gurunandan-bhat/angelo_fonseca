                        Fonseca, the underappreciated and forgotten master, not
                        unlike the courageous biblical prophets he painted, “had
                        been run down from his native Goa for mixing up
                        traditional biblical scenes with Hindu, Buddhist and Jain
                        elements,” in an attempt to promote social interaction and
                        integration. Fonseca has not yet captured the eye and
                        judgement of the larger art world who have the capacity to
                        confer on his paintings the certification of good
                        art. Will a full recognition continue to elude this
                        deserving and talented Goan artist? It is a tragedy that
                        Fonseca is barely known. Though his work was exhibited
                        during his lifetime and thereafter, both in India, Goa and
                        abroad, he continues to remain in obscurity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even during his lifetime, only a handful of art critics
                        have celebrated Fonseca for his original talent and
                        work. They interpreted him without paying attention to his
                        social and political environment and message. They
                        highlighted all the right formal aspects of his art but
                        omitted to link his art to his political and social
                        experiences. Unfortunately, there is no permanent gallery
                        that befits Fonseca or displays his work. Literature on
                        his work is not easily available. Without a gallery or
                        corroborating literature, it may not be possible to
                        convincingly convey the significance of his quest and its
                        relevance and importance for us. A dedicated Fonseca
                        gallery as a cross-cultural space is absolutely essential
                        to rescue his genius and re-present it to the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The book will examine and suggest the current significance
                        of Fonseca’s works. It is also a story of Goa and its
                        uneasy relationship with its talented and famous
                        artists. Even as change ripples in the world of visual
                        arts in India, peerless Goan artists who vigorously feed
                        modern Indian art like ‘an invisible river’, continue to
                        find virtually no recognition and space in the
                        postcolonial scenario. The blame should perhaps fall on
                        apathetic Goans who disregard their artists and toss
                        inspiring chapters of their history and heritage to the
                        winds. How on earth could people with so much talent and
                        artistic heritage let go of some of their magnificent
                        history and invaluable art? It’s a paradox that needs to
                        be addressed and set right! It is never too late to
                        recover the neglected, forgotten pages of our creative
                        history. Accord our creative artists and thinkers, the
                        space and recognition that is their due, and in the
                        process rediscover and retrieve lost fragments of our
                        heritage for the greater good of the community.

                    <p>
                        Until the 1970s, Fonseca’s art benefitted from a few
                        sporadic, genial presentations in the Catholic Church. The
                        clergy salvaged Fonseca, but only very selectively and
                        reluctantly, to demonstrate the Church’s narrative of
                        cultural adaptation.  Today the Church does not seem to
                        find Fonseca as interesting and deserving of attention. To
                        be fair, the present attitude of indifference is not
                        exclusive to Indian Christian art, but extends to all
                        Christian art in general. Exhibited or not, the Fonsecas
                        continue to offer insights into our history and ourselves
                        as never before. He is a bridge between the past and
                        present, his oeuvres are immersed in their historical time
                        and space as well as in ours. To understand Fonseca’s work
                        and context, is to gain an insight into our past and
                        present, disconcerting as it may be. This after all is the
                        function of art in society &mdash; to reveal that behind
                        apparent order there is chaos. And behind knowledge,
                        sometimes pretension!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To understand Fonseca, one has to factor in the historical
                        times he lived in, infer and establish the influences on
                        his persona and work: the political and artistic movements
                        in the country at the time, the artistic practice in the
                        Catholic Church, the contextual and cosmopolitan
                        modernisms in India and the artist’s personal beliefs and
                        ideology. Only then can one examine and comprehend the
                        context and background of his life’s work. “He would seem
                        then, at least on paper, to have excellent credentials for
                        standing among the best-known Indian artists of the past
                        hundred years.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Presently, the custodian of Fonseca’s artistic legacy is
                        the Xavier Centre of Historical Research (XCHR), in Goa,
                        an institution run by the Jesuit religious order or the
                        Society of Jesus. In 2006, the artist’s widow, Mrs Ivy da
                        Fonseca, entrusted the entire artistic patrimony to the
                        Jesuits, under a legal agreement to set up a permanent
                        gallery for Fonseca. XCHR aims to reinstate Fonseca’s
                        vision and bring him into more focused public
                        attention. Efforts are on to create an appropriate display
                        assemblage-space befitting his significant legacy to our
                        State, nation and the world. As well as create
                        opportunities for researchers to study the collection. The
                        Fonseca legacy adds to an already-existing XCHR repertoire
                        of several other Fonsecas purchased decades earlier. Since
                        its inception in 1540, the Society of Jesus has become the
                        foremost global creator, curator, broker and patron of
                        cultures, literature, arts and visual arts. The Jesuits
                        had a clear notion about the importance of culture and the
                        visual arts for their enterprise.

                    <p>
                        On learning I was writing a much-awaited book on Angelo da
                        Fonseca, Mrs Ivy da Fonseca has kindly permitted
                        publication of several images of Fonseca’s paintings.  A
                        Jesuit colleague, Fr. Josef Übelmesser SJ, who studied
                        theology in Pune, India, in the 1960s, had met the artist
                        at the time and purchased several Fonsecas for the Jesuit
                        Mission Office in Germany.  Fr. Übelmesser SJ and
                        Fr. Klaus Väthröder SJ, both German Jesuits, from the
                        Missionsprokur of the Jesuits, Nürnberg, Germany, were
                        kind enough to permit me to photograph for this book
                        several Fonsecas from their archives. Jesuit interest in
                        and patronage to Fonseca during his lifetime and after is
                        an ongoing collaboration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was privileged to be a member of the Xavier Centre of
                        Historical Research when hundreds of unsold Fonsecas were
                        donated to the Centre. Some of them are world treasures
                        and would be the cynosure of art collectors. I had the
                        rare opportunity to study them very closely for
                        years. Together with Vivek Menezes, an art critic and
                        writer who introduced me to the Goan art world and became
                        my mentor, we curated a few Angelo da Fonseca
                        exhibitions. Menezes had played a very constructive
                        curatorial role at the institution then under my
                        directorship. However, every effort made then to provide
                        Fonseca a meritorious public space at the Xavier Centre
                        was not successful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The beneficiaries of Fonseca’s legacy have a duty to
                        reinstate Fonseca. His legacy and message ought to become
                        more than just a matter of seeing and thinking -- it ought
                        to become a way of being and doing. That is what art is
                        all about. A Fonseca gallery would go a long way towards
                        helping us understand his significance to Goa in
                        particular, and to Christianity in India. I am optimistic
                        that Fonseca’s brilliant submissions will soon attract a
                        studious public who will recognise and appreciate such a
                        genial way of being in the world.
