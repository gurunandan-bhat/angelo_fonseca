            Fonseca, the underappreciated and forgotten master, not
            unlike the courageous biblical prophets he painted, “had
            been run down from his native Goa for mixing up
            traditional biblical scenes with Hindu, Buddhist and Jain
            elements,” in an attempt to promote social interaction and
            integration. Fonseca has not yet captured the eye and
            judgement of the larger art world who have the capacity to
            confer on his paintings the certification of good
            art. Will a full recognition continue to elude this
            deserving and talented Goan artist? It is a tragedy that
            Fonseca is barely known. Though his work was exhibited
            during his lifetime and thereafter, both in India, Goa and
            abroad, he continues to remain in obscurity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even during his lifetime, only a handful of art critics
            have celebrated Fonseca for his original talent and
            work. They interpreted him without paying attention to his
            social and political environment and message. They
            highlighted all the right formal aspects of his art but
            omitted to link his art to his political and social
            experiences. Unfortunately, there is no permanent gallery
            that befits Fonseca or displays his work. Literature on
            his work is not easily available. Without a gallery or
            corroborating literature, it may not be possible to
            convincingly convey the significance of his quest and its
            relevance and importance for us. A dedicated Fonseca
            gallery as a cross-cultural space is absolutely essential
            to rescue his genius and re-present it to the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            The book will examine and suggest the current significance
            of Fonseca’s works. It is also a story of Goa and its
            uneasy relationship with its talented and famous
            artists. Even as change ripples in the world of visual
            arts in India, peerless Goan artists who vigorously feed
            modern Indian art like ‘an invisible river’, continue to
            find virtually no recognition and space in the
            postcolonial scenario. The blame should perhaps fall on
            apathetic Goans who disregard their artists and toss
            inspiring chapters of their history and heritage to the
            winds. How on earth could people with so much talent and
            artistic heritage let go of some of their magnificent
            history and invaluable art? It’s a paradox that needs to
            be addressed and set right! It is never too late to
            recover the neglected, forgotten pages of our creative
            history. Accord our creative artists and thinkers, the
            space and recognition that is their due, and in the
            process rediscover and retrieve lost fragments of our
            heritage for the greater good of the community.
          </p>

            Until the 1970s, Fonseca’s art benefitted from a few
            sporadic, genial presentations in the Catholic Church. The
            clergy salvaged Fonseca, but only very selectively and
            reluctantly, to demonstrate the Church’s narrative of
            cultural adaptation.  Today the Church does not seem to
            find Fonseca as interesting and deserving of attention. To
            be fair, the present attitude of indifference is not
            exclusive to Indian Christian art, but extends to all
            Christian art in general. Exhibited or not, the Fonsecas
            continue to offer insights into our history and ourselves
            as never before. He is a bridge between the past and
            present, his oeuvres are immersed in their historical time
            and space as well as in ours. To understand Fonseca’s work
            and context, is to gain an insight into our past and
            present, disconcerting as it may be. This after all is the
            function of art in society &mdash; to reveal that behind
            apparent order there is chaos. And behind knowledge,
            sometimes pretension!
          </p>
          <p>
            To understand Fonseca, one has to factor in the historical
            times he lived in, infer and establish the influences on
            his persona and work: the political and artistic movements
            in the country at the time, the artistic practice in the
            Catholic Church, the contextual and cosmopolitan
            modernisms in India and the artist’s personal beliefs and
            ideology. Only then can one examine and comprehend the
            context and background of his life’s work. “He would seem
            then, at least on paper, to have excellent credentials for
            standing among the best-known Indian artists of the past
            hundred years.”

            Presently, the custodian of Fonseca’s artistic legacy is
            the Xavier Centre of Historical Research (XCHR), in Goa,
            an institution run by the Jesuit religious order or the
            Society of Jesus. In 2006, the artist’s widow, Mrs Ivy da
            Fonseca, entrusted the entire artistic patrimony to the
            Jesuits, under a legal agreement to set up a permanent
            gallery for Fonseca. XCHR aims to reinstate Fonseca’s
            vision and bring him into more focused public
            attention. Efforts are on to create an appropriate display
            assemblage-space befitting his significant legacy to our
            State, nation and the world. As well as create
            opportunities for researchers to study the collection. The
            Fonseca legacy adds to an already-existing XCHR repertoire
            of several other Fonsecas purchased decades earlier. Since
            its inception in 1540, the Society of Jesus has become the
            foremost global creator, curator, broker and patron of
            cultures, literature, arts and visual arts. The Jesuits
            had a clear notion about the importance of culture and the
            visual arts for their enterprise.
          </p>
          <p>
            On learning I was writing a much-awaited book on Angelo da
            Fonseca, Mrs Ivy da Fonseca has kindly permitted
            publication of several images of Fonseca’s paintings.  A
            Jesuit colleague, Fr. Josef Übelmesser SJ, who studied
            theology in Pune, India, in the 1960s, had met the artist
            at the time and purchased several Fonsecas for the Jesuit
            Mission Office in Germany.  Fr. Übelmesser SJ and
            Fr. Klaus Väthröder SJ, both German Jesuits, from the
            Missionsprokur of the Jesuits, Nürnberg, Germany, were
            kind enough to permit me to photograph for this book
            several Fonsecas from their archives. Jesuit interest in
            and patronage to Fonseca during his lifetime and after is
            an ongoing collaboration.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was privileged to be a member of the Xavier Centre of
            Historical Research when hundreds of unsold Fonsecas were
            donated to the Centre. Some of them are world treasures
            and would be the cynosure of art collectors. I had the
            rare opportunity to study them very closely for
            years. Together with Vivek Menezes, an art critic and
            writer who introduced me to the Goan art world and became
            my mentor, we curated a few Angelo da Fonseca
            exhibitions. Menezes had played a very constructive
            curatorial role at the institution then under my
            directorship. However, every effort made then to provide
            Fonseca a meritorious public space at the Xavier Centre
            was not successful.
          </p>
          <p>
            The beneficiaries of Fonseca’s legacy have a duty to
            reinstate Fonseca. His legacy and message ought to become
            more than just a matter of seeing and thinking -- it ought
            to become a way of being and doing. That is what art is
            all about. A Fonseca gallery would go a long way towards
            helping us understand his significance to Goa in
            particular, and to Christianity in India. I am optimistic
            that Fonseca’s brilliant submissions will soon attract a
            studious public who will recognise and appreciate such a
            genial way of being in the world.
