                        One way of judging an artist is by his or her success or
                        failure in the art market. Art should also be assessed by
                        the answers they offer to important questions or the
                        germane issues they raise. Fonseca’s artistic patrimony
                        motivates Christians to examine their own cultural and
                        political responsibilities, rights and prejudices. In the
                        last two decades, Goa has consistently asserted its
                        contribution to and place in the Indian narrative of
                        modernism. Five hundred years ago, Goa became the first
                        transcultural and transcontinental hub in the Indian
                        subcontinent, nay in Asia, and what had begun as a trickle
                        had developed into a torrent with multiple tributaries
                        through the Goan diaspora. This idea was revisited and Goa
                        was reinstated once again on the world map. How Fonseca
                        contributed to the discourse of modernism and
                        transculturalism is the subject of this volume.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I intend these submissions to be a story of both Fonseca’s
                        short-lived success and very long obscurity, his modernism
                        and traditionalism, his Indiannism and occidentalism, his
                        Indic renaissance and western academism, and his artistic
                        substance and form.  One element of the binary does not
                        contradict or cancel the other but complements
                        it. Fonseca’s art is also about the interface or meeting
                        of oppositional features: brown and blue-eyed images,
                        black and blond hair figures, desi (indigenous) and
                        western trappings, flat and perspectival drawing.  His
                        eclectic forms and thought made possible the bridging of
                        both spectra till then kept apart. Fonseca was a
                        connoisseur of the concept of rasa in Indian
                        aesthetics. Rasa creates cross-cultural and emotional
                        bridges not a clash of opposites. This concept could also
                        mean the “entanglement of concepts, theories and set of
                        meanings of the knowledge system” that facilitate the
                        construction of cross-cultural spaces. The Fonsecas merit
                        a gallery to achieve this worthy purpose.

                    <p>
                        Fonseca’s works flavoured with rasa – the indescribable
                        emotions produced by art that the artists communicate
                        through his or her works to the viewer or listener &mdash; have
                        the potential to bring together diverse ethnic and
                        religious groups and worldviews. His art shows that people
                        can coexist, dialogue and connect peacefully. In my
                        opinion that is the quintessential purpose of art.  That
                        is also the purpose of rasa. Emperor Akbar had
                        understood. Fonseca followed the aesthetic of rasa to
                        render his community and nation more connected!

                    <p>
                        The book also discusses Fonseca’s artistic vicissitudes
                        for which Goa’s history must bear a large share of
                        responsibility. Like all territories, the region’s history
                        is tied up with conquest and re-conquest. Each conqueror
                        alienates it from its previous history and art of the
                        past. It explains why Fonseca failed to impact Goan
                        cultural sensibilities, despite the region being
                        inherently modernist, hybrid and with a global cultural
                        disposition. And why Goa’s artists and heritage continue
                        to be, consciously or otherwise, pushed into the
                        peripheries of oblivion by both the state and learned
                        public. The distressing story of how Goa lost and is still
                        losing its art, would certainly make many sincere art
                        conservators and specialists angry.

                        One view is that few places in the world have mismanaged
                        and disrespected their artistic heritage and artistic
                        identity as badly as Goa. The poignant story of how we
                        failed to protect our artistic treasures and talented
                        artists has several lessons for us. I have attempted to
                        weave together a story -- along with our collective and
                        systematic artistic indifference, and even opposition from
                        those who claim to be custodians of culture and the arts
                        &mdash; about the handling of the large repertoire of Fonseca’s
                        oeuvres. The story could provide some insights into
                        certain aspects of Goan identity and mentality, not least
                        of the Church that once was a committed supporter of the
                        arts.

                    <p>
                        The churches in India, in general, are poor in religious
                        paintings, iconography and artefacts and even poorer in
                        Indian art.  This situation is not because of a lack of
                        local talent or artistic goodwill but mainly because of a
                        very unfortunate sense and practice of preserving,
                        restoring, curating and creating artworks.  The absence of
                        passionate artistic patronage is another setback.  All
                        added, the outcome is the alienation of talented artists
                        from the Church’s pictorial aesthetics with the clergy
                        showing little interest in dialoguing with artists,
                        curators, conservators and restorers. There is
                        disorientation about the importance and purpose of art for
                        the Church’s mission. That state of affairs contributes to
                        a dearth of philosophical and theological thought on
                        Christian art in India.

                        Fonseca’s Madonnas in particular are way different from
                        those seen adorning traditional churches, sanctuaries,
                        private homes and devotional literature and are therefore
                        central to our narrative.  These Madonnas with oriental
                        features did not appeal then to honest and devout Catholic
                        women and men. They felt it did not represent the beauty,
                        divinity, fairness and purity that the Madonna
                        deserves. The Indian Catholic community entrenched in a
                        system of castes, social status and skin tone had great
                        difficulty owning such images. The same attitude was also
                        shown towards all the other religious paintings of
                        Fonseca.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, Christians continue to ignore Fonseca’s works for
                        much the same reasons. The Indic features could hardly fit
                        into traditional Christian spirituality.  Those brought up
                        to venerate reproductions of holy images made in the West
                        could simply not make a mental devotional transition.
                        Western tradition, tempered over centuries, provided them
                        security, certainty and clear darshan. In such a highly
                        regulated environment Fonseca could not succeed. He made
                        it almost alone on the road less travelled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fonseca was ignored by modernism and traditionalism alike
                        for mixing both ‘isms’. His artistic career developed
                        along polyvalent paths, a characteristic of Indian
                        modernism. His choice of composite aesthetics sets him
                        apart but also outside. Aware of the social prejudices and
                        fixed practises, Fonseca continued till the end to create
                        cross-cultural frames with his art. He traversed with ease
                        from one tradition and culture to another to create new
                        artistic templates. The social response to this art was
                        antinomic: avoidance and tolerance, obliteration and
                        celebration, renouncement and retrieval, with the first in
                        the binary taking precedence. Fonseca’s methodology
                        continues to remain enigmatically complex even today and
                        necessitates an inclusive hermeneutics to decode
                        it. However, to think in inclusive and transcultural terms
                        is naturally not our forte.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fonseca’s contribution was nonetheless occasionally
                        acknowledged in several places as chapter seven shows. He
                        emerged as a cultural bridge between western and eastern
                        artistic schools, between traditional and modernist
                        trends, and between artistic traditions in India and
                        Christianity.  How did Fonseca rise above his colonial and
                        narrow settings to the extent of providing us with a much
                        larger postcolonial darshan (vision) of reality? How are
                        we to harmonise Fonseca as a traditional practising
                        Christian with Fonseca as an unconventional artist? Or
                        Fonseca as a modernist with Fonseca as a practitioner of
                        the neo-Bengal art style, labels seemingly incompatible?
                        Genius artists enjoy a perception of the world and life
                        that is very different from ours! Fonseca’s saga,
                        worldview, oeuvres, and attitudes towards his art during
                        his and our present times are the subject matter of this
                        monograph.  This story will continue to unfold the
                        historical Fonseca, the artistic traditions, masters,
                        Indian modernism and political developments that
                        reconfigured art in India, and influenced the genius of
                        Fonseca.
