            One way of judging an artist is by his or her success or
            failure in the art market. Art should also be assessed by
            the answers they offer to important questions or the
            germane issues they raise. Fonseca’s artistic patrimony
            motivates Christians to examine their own cultural and
            political responsibilities, rights and prejudices. In the
            last two decades, Goa has consistently asserted its
            contribution to and place in the Indian narrative of
            modernism. Five hundred years ago, Goa became the first
            transcultural and transcontinental hub in the Indian
            subcontinent, nay in Asia, and what had begun as a trickle
            had developed into a torrent with multiple tributaries
            through the Goan diaspora. This idea was revisited and Goa
            was reinstated once again on the world map. How Fonseca
            contributed to the discourse of modernism and
            transculturalism is the subject of this volume.
          </p>
          <p>
            I intend these submissions to be a story of both Fonseca’s
            short-lived success and very long obscurity, his modernism
            and traditionalism, his Indiannism and occidentalism, his
            Indic renaissance and western academism, and his artistic
            substance and form.  One element of the binary does not
            contradict or cancel the other but complements
            it. Fonseca’s art is also about the interface or meeting
            of oppositional features: brown and blue-eyed images,
            black and blond hair figures, desi (indigenous) and
            western trappings, flat and perspectival drawing.  His
            eclectic forms and thought made possible the bridging of
            both spectra till then kept apart. Fonseca was a
            connoisseur of the concept of rasa in Indian
            aesthetics. Rasa creates cross-cultural and emotional
            bridges not a clash of opposites. This concept could also
            mean the “entanglement of concepts, theories and set of
            meanings of the knowledge system” that facilitate the
            construction of cross-cultural spaces. The Fonsecas merit
            a gallery to achieve this worthy purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fonseca’s works flavoured with rasa – the indescribable
            emotions produced by art that the artists communicate
            through his or her works to the viewer or listener &mdash; have
            the potential to bring together diverse ethnic and
            religious groups and worldviews. His art shows that people
            can coexist, dialogue and connect peacefully. In my
            opinion that is the quintessential purpose of art.  That
            is also the purpose of rasa. Emperor Akbar had
            understood. Fonseca followed the aesthetic of rasa to
            render his community and nation more connected!
          </p>
          <p>
            The book also discusses Fonseca’s artistic vicissitudes
            for which Goa’s history must bear a large share of
            responsibility. Like all territories, the region’s history
            is tied up with conquest and re-conquest. Each conqueror
            alienates it from its previous history and art of the
            past. It explains why Fonseca failed to impact Goan
            cultural sensibilities, despite the region being
            inherently modernist, hybrid and with a global cultural
            disposition. And why Goa’s artists and heritage continue
            to be, consciously or otherwise, pushed into the
            peripheries of oblivion by both the state and learned
            public. The distressing story of how Goa lost and is still
            losing its art, would certainly make many sincere art
            conservators and specialists angry.
          </p>
          <p>
            One view is that few places in the world have mismanaged
            and disrespected their artistic heritage and artistic
            identity as badly as Goa. The poignant story of how we
            failed to protect our artistic treasures and talented
            artists has several lessons for us. I have attempted to
            weave together a story -- along with our collective and
            systematic artistic indifference, and even opposition from
            those who claim to be custodians of culture and the arts
            &mdash; about the handling of the large repertoire of Fonseca’s
            oeuvres. The story could provide some insights into
            certain aspects of Goan identity and mentality, not least
            of the Church that once was a committed supporter of the
            arts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The churches in India, in general, are poor in religious
            paintings, iconography and artefacts and even poorer in
            Indian art.  This situation is not because of a lack of
            local talent or artistic goodwill but mainly because of a
            very unfortunate sense and practice of preserving,
            restoring, curating and creating artworks.  The absence of
            passionate artistic patronage is another setback.  All
            added, the outcome is the alienation of talented artists
            from the Church’s pictorial aesthetics with the clergy
            showing little interest in dialoguing with artists,
            curators, conservators and restorers. There is
            disorientation about the importance and purpose of art for
            the Church’s mission. That state of affairs contributes to
            a dearth of philosophical and theological thought on
            Christian art in India.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fonseca’s Madonnas in particular are way different from
            those seen adorning traditional churches, sanctuaries,
            private homes and devotional literature and are therefore
            central to our narrative.  These Madonnas with oriental
            features did not appeal then to honest and devout Catholic
            women and men. They felt it did not represent the beauty,
            divinity, fairness and purity that the Madonna
            deserves. The Indian Catholic community entrenched in a
            system of castes, social status and skin tone had great
            difficulty owning such images. The same attitude was also
            shown towards all the other religious paintings of
            Fonseca.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, Christians continue to ignore Fonseca’s works for
            much the same reasons. The Indic features could hardly fit
            into traditional Christian spirituality.  Those brought up
            to venerate reproductions of holy images made in the West
            could simply not make a mental devotional transition.
            Western tradition, tempered over centuries, provided them
            security, certainty and clear darshan. In such a highly
            regulated environment Fonseca could not succeed. He made
            it almost alone on the road less travelled.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fonseca was ignored by modernism and traditionalism alike
            for mixing both ‘isms’. His artistic career developed
            along polyvalent paths, a characteristic of Indian
            modernism. His choice of composite aesthetics sets him
            apart but also outside. Aware of the social prejudices and
            fixed practises, Fonseca continued till the end to create
            cross-cultural frames with his art. He traversed with ease
            from one tradition and culture to another to create new
            artistic templates. The social response to this art was
            antinomic: avoidance and tolerance, obliteration and
            celebration, renouncement and retrieval, with the first in
            the binary taking precedence. Fonseca’s methodology
            continues to remain enigmatically complex even today and
            necessitates an inclusive hermeneutics to decode
            it. However, to think in inclusive and transcultural terms
            is naturally not our forte.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fonseca’s contribution was nonetheless occasionally
            acknowledged in several places as chapter seven shows. He
            emerged as a cultural bridge between western and eastern
            artistic schools, between traditional and modernist
            trends, and between artistic traditions in India and
            Christianity.  How did Fonseca rise above his colonial and
            narrow settings to the extent of providing us with a much
            larger postcolonial darshan (vision) of reality? How are
            we to harmonise Fonseca as a traditional practising
            Christian with Fonseca as an unconventional artist? Or
            Fonseca as a modernist with Fonseca as a practitioner of
            the neo-Bengal art style, labels seemingly incompatible?
            Genius artists enjoy a perception of the world and life
            that is very different from ours! Fonseca’s saga,
            worldview, oeuvres, and attitudes towards his art during
            his and our present times are the subject matter of this
            monograph.  This story will continue to unfold the
            historical Fonseca, the artistic traditions, masters,
            Indian modernism and political developments that
            reconfigured art in India, and influenced the genius of
            Fonseca.
